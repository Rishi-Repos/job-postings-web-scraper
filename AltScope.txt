Understand website structures: Different websites have different layouts and anti-scraping measures. You'll need to adapt your scraping methods accordingly. 

2. Setting up the scraping infrastructure

    Choose your tools:
        Programming Languages: Python and JavaScript are popular choices due to their robust libraries and frameworks.
        Web Scraping Libraries/Frameworks:
            For static websites: requests (Python) or Axios (JavaScript) for fetching content, combined with HTML parsers like BeautifulSoup (Python) or Cheerio (JavaScript).
            For dynamic websites: Headless browsers like Selenium or Playwright (for Python and JavaScript) are necessary to render JavaScript and interact with elements.
            For large-scale projects: Scrapy (Python) is a powerful and efficient framework for handling large volumes of data and complex crawling tasks.
    Handle anti-scraping mechanisms:
        Proxies: Use a reliable proxy service to rotate IP addresses, avoid detection and blocking.
        CAPTCHA Solvers: Consider integrating a CAPTCHA-solving service or advanced web scraping APIs that handle CAPTCHAs automatically.
        User-Agent Rotation: Mimic human browsing by rotating User-Agent headers.
        Rate Limiting: Implement delays between requests to avoid overloading the server.
        Respect Robots.txt and Terms of Service: Always check these files for rules and restrictions on web scraping. 

3. Developing the scraper

    Write the scraping logic: Use the chosen tools and techniques to identify and extract relevant data points from the target websites (job titles, descriptions, company names, locations, salaries, application links, etc.).
    Handle Pagination and Dynamic Content: Ensure your scraper can navigate through multiple pages and handle elements loaded dynamically with JavaScript. 

4. Storing the scraped data

    Choose a storage solution:
        Databases: Relational (MySQL, PostgreSQL) or NoSQL (MongoDB) databases are suitable for storing structured and semi-structured data respectively, especially for large datasets.
        Cloud Storage: Solutions like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage offer scalability and durability for raw data and archiving, according to InstantAPI.
        Files: CSV or JSON files are suitable for smaller datasets.
    Design a Data Pipeline: Automate the processes of cleaning, transforming, and loading the scraped data into your chosen storage solution using tools like Apache Airflow or AWS Glue. 

5. Building the website and displaying the data

    Choose a Web Framework: Select a framework like Django or Flask (Python) or React or Angular (JavaScript) for building the user interface of your job board.
    Develop Search and Filter Functionality: Enable users to easily search and filter job postings based on criteria like keywords, location, and industry.
    Create a User-Friendly Interface: Design an intuitive and visually appealing interface to display the scraped job postings. 

6. Deployment and maintenance

    Deploy your website: Use cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure to host your website and manage the scraping infrastructure.
    Monitor and Update: Regularly monitor your scraper for errors, adapt to changes in website structures, and update your code to maintain data accuracy and prevent detection. 

Important considerations

    Legal and Ethical Implications: Be mindful of copyright laws, terms of service, and privacy regulations when scraping data.
    Respect Website Policies: Avoid overloading servers, use IP rotation, and comply with robots.txt files to ensure ethical scraping practices.
    Data Quality and Accuracy: Implement robust data validation and cleaning processes to ensure the scraped data is reliable and consistent.
    Scalability and Performance: Consider using cloud services, load balancing, and efficient data processing techniques to handle large datasets and growing traffic. 

Disclaimer: Web scraping can be complex and may require specialized knowledge. Always consult legal counsel to ensure your practices comply with all relevant laws and regulations.
